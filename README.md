# Landing Page Project
This project is a landing page 

I used javaScript to make a Navigation Bar dynamically to interact with the sections in the page

I created function to build the navbar in the page
I created function to make the scrolling from section to section smooth
I created function to change the apperance of sections while scrolling throw it.

I used some built in methods and objects like 
.getBoundingClientRect()
.addEventListener()
.appendChild()
.querySelectorAll()
.createElement()
.innerHTML
